# Is it an Anagram?

Write a function that receives two words (Strings) and returns true or false (Bool) depending on whether they are anagrams. 

An Anagram consists of forming a word by rearranging ALL the letters of another original word.

* It's NOT necessary to verify that both words exist.
* Two identical words are not anagrams.
